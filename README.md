### Overview

PARA is a productivity methodology by [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.co/) for organizing personal knowledge and tasks.

### The Four Categories

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Projects** | Short-term efforts with a clear goal and deadline | "Launch new website", "Complete tax return" |
| **Areas** | Long-term responsibilities with no deadline | "Health", "Finance", "Professional development" |
| **Resources** | Topics of ongoing interest | "Productivity tips", "Cooking recipes", "Marketing research" |
| **Archives** | Completed or inactive items | Old projects, outdated resources |

### How to Use

1. **Projects**: Create a new markdown file for each project. Use the `_template.md` as a starting point.
2. **Areas**: Add files for ongoing responsibilities you need to maintain.
3. **Resources**: Store information on topics you're interested in or researching.
4. **Archives**: Move completed projects or inactive items here when done.

### Tips

- Review Projects weekly
- Review Areas monthly
- Archive items regularly to keep your system clean
- Keep file names descriptive and concise
