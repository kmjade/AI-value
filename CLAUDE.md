# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

**AI-value** is a newly initialized repository in early planning phase. No code, build system, or development tools have been configured yet.

## Repository Information

- **License:** Apache 2.0
- **Remote:** https://github.com/kmjade/AI-value.git
- **Primary branch:** `main`
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA (`.idea/` directory present)

## Current State

The repository contains minimal files:
- `README.md` - Project title only
- `LICENSE` - Apache 2.0
- `.gitignore` - Ignores `.idea/` directory
- `.claude/` - Empty directory for Claude Code configuration

## Development Notes

The project's purpose, technology stack, and architecture have not yet been determined. Initial `.gitignore` entries suggested LangChain/LangGraph but were removed, indicating the tech stack is undecided.

When implementing features:
1. Define the project's purpose and goals first
2. Choose appropriate technology stack
3. Set up build system, testing, and linting tools
4. Create proper documentation
